## Getting Started

If you are new to Aviatrix the first thing you will need to do is launch a Controller. You may be operating in one Cloud today many organizations operate in in more than one cloud or are planning to **_(Multi-Cloud)_**. Many organizations have a **_Primary Cloud_** where governance and other shared processes are centralized in, have run into limitations, or are looking to expand.

**Aviatrix dramatically accelerates multicloud strategies and overcomes native limitations in individual cloud providers no matter where you are in your Cloud Journey. Try out some of the Terraform Solutions here and see for yourself. Check out the [Aviatrix website](https://aviatrix.com/) to see what our customers are saying.**

**One** Aviatrix Controller is all you need to deploy in any major cloud provider.

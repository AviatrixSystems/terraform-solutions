# Solutions

A sub-directory will be created here for each family of solutions.

It's better to be direct than indirect, so if there is something that is specific to a particular pattern park it here chances are it will be useful to others.

## Guidance for Contributing

- Each Solution will contain a readme defining the scenario, scope, CSP(s), and any Vendor information references required if needed (i.e. FireNet).

- Each Solution will contain the TF code necessary to implement it, recommend it is peer reviewed or tested by the Contributor 

## Support Policy

- Issues reported on any Solution that are not resolved in a reasonable amount of time will result in removal from the repo

## Contributing

- We welcome pull requests and are open to individuals and Partners sharing solutions that will help others accelerate their journey. It's a great place to show off your work!

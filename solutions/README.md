# Solutions

A sub-directory will be created here for each family of solutions. Within each family there will be tailored solutions in unique directories that can be used to accelerate POCs, training efforts, and partner initiatives.

It's better to be direct than indirect, so if there is something that is specific to a particular pattern park it here chances are it will be useful to others.

## Solution Families

### [Aviatrix Transit](./aviatrix-transit)

### [Transit FireNet](./transit-firenet)

### [User VPN](./vpn)


## Guidance for Contributing

- Each Solution will contain a readme defining the scenario, scope, CSP(s), and any Vendor information references required if needed (i.e. FireNet).

- Each Solution will contain the TF code necessary to implement it, recommend it is peer reviewed or tested by the Contributor 

- We welcome pull requests and are open to individuals and Partners sharing solutions that will help others accelerate their journey. It's a great place to show off your work!

## Support Policy

- Issues reported on any Solution that are not resolved in a reasonable amount of time will result in removal from the repo
